ðŸ“š Webapp to be audited as part of final assessment for first JS module

This was a final project for our capstone on Interactive Web Apps, where I had to edit the script.js on VSCode and make the website functional. 
It took a week to complete and I met most of the requierments. 
A presentation was also required, which I have included. 

**#User Stories**
- As a user, I want to view a list of book previews, by title and author, so that I can discover new books to read.
- As a user, I want an image associated with all book previews so that I can recognize a book by the cover even if I forgot the name.
- As a user, I want to have the option of reading a summary of the book so that I can decide whether I want to read it.
- As a user, I want to have the option of seeing the date that a book was published so that I can determine how easy it is to obtain second-hand.
- As a user, I want to find books based on specific text phrases so that I donâ€™t need to remember the entire title of a book.
- As a user, I want to filter books by author so that I can find books to read by authors that I enjoy.
- As a user, I want to filter books by genre so that I can find books to read in genres that I enjoy.
- As a user, I want to toggle between dark and light modes so that I can use the app comfortably at night.
