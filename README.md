ðŸ“š Webapp to be audited as part of final assessment for first JS module

This was a final project for our capstone on Interactive Web Apps, where I had to edit the script.js on VSCode and make the website functional. 
It took a week to complete and I met most of the requierments. 
A presentation was also required, which I have included.
